When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share work with other developers, use multiple development environments, create a backup for your work, and to publish your work to the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You wouldn't want to constantly update if there are collaborators on the project.
